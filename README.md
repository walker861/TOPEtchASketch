## Overview

This was a good challenge that helped me to develop confidence in my ability to manipulate the DOM. There is obviously still major room for growth but I am pleased that I came to the current solution simply through researching the problem at hand.

There is one part of the challenge that I have not been able to solve. This is the incrementing of the opacity by 10% per event triggered. I plan to revisit this project to see if I can refactor it after more learning. For now, I plan to move forward and will return in an attempt to refine my current product after I have successfully built more projects.

### What I learned

I have learned more about DOM manipulation through this project and learned a little more about the concept of scope. I'm sure there are ways to refactor the current code to improve its readability and keep it DRY. However, I have a viable solution that I can revisit as I gain more experience. It will be a good practice for me to revisit my old projects and attempt to revise what I wrote with less experience.
